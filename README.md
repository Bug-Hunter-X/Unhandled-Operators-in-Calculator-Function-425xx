This repository contains a JavaScript function that performs basic arithmetic operations.  The `operate` function takes an operator (+, -, *, /) and two numbers as input. However, there is a bug: it doesn't handle all possible operators, throwing an error if an unsupported operator is used. This example demonstrates the issue and a simple solution.
